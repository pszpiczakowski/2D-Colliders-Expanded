# 2D-Capsule-Collider
Created by Timothy Kebr, October 2015

I often found myself wanting for a 2D version of Unity's 3D Capsule Collider. This is a unity 2D Collision asset created in an attempt to provide a native-feeling solution to this issue. The script is attached to a GameObject and creates a compound 2D Capsule Collider from 2D Circle and Box colliders.

Features:
isTrigger, Offset, Radius, Height, Rotation Axis
