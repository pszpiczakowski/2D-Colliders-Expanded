### 2D-Colliders-Expanded
Created by Timothy Kebr, October 2015

Unity's default 2D colliders are lacking. The shape you want is very complicated to create with just the default colliders? Need some *curves*? 2D Colliders Expanded seeks to fill some of those gaps in a native-feeling way.

Right now, the project adds the following new colliders to Unity's 2D Collision system:
  - **Curved Edge Collider 2D**
  - **Semi-Circle Collider 2D**
  - **Capsule Collider 2D**
