_**A Unity2D Collision Improvement Project**_

*Created by Timothy Kebr, October 2015*

#### Additions:
Right now, the project adds the following new colliders to Unity's 2D Collision system:
  - **Curved Edge Collider 2D**
  - **Semi-Circle Collider 2D**
  - **Capsule Collider 2D**

#### Description:
Unity's default 2D colliders are lacking. Is the shape you want too complicated to create with just the default colliders? Need some *curves*? 2D Colliders Expanded seeks to fill some of those gaps in a native-feeling way.

#### Usage:
- Attach the script to a GameObject
- The Collider will be created as a child of the GameObject
